# Minimalist Portfolio Project
A Minimalistic Portfolio design using minimal pages to create a seamless experience.

# Please do not just take the design/code of this website.
I would love to inspire users to create something similar to what i am creating but i want people to do it own their own so they can learn and become a better engineer. The code is open source and you can use it to learn or mess around with it but dont just copy it and change the name and call it a day. People want to see what YOU can do, Not what you can copy. Creating a portfolio is about learning and showing off the skills you have obtained. Thank you.

# Whats to come?
Im still working on the first popup at the moment making it more responsive for different display sizes. Once im happy with it i will work on the main screen.
The main page will have a one page design using buttons on the left (home, experience, projects, contact) to hide/show the divs on the right that will either include buttons for the project section that leads to the github repo of the project or a website showcasing the project. Im intending to learn more about the animations part of CSS and im enjoying it so im hoping to do some cool stuff with the animations and javaScript combined! Will keep this github update when i make changes.
